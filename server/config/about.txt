This folder acts as the central storage for settings that your application needs to function.

Database Settings: Contains scripts or configuration files (like db.js) that define how to connect to your MySQL database.

Environment Variables: Stores sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and JWT secrets in a way that’s easy to manage across different environments (e.g., development vs. production).

Global Constants: Holds values that don't change often, such as your server's port number or external service URLs.
